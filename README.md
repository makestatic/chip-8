CHIP-8 was created by Joseph Weisbecker in the mid-1970s. Itâ€™s a simple programming language with hexadecimal instructions that run on a virtual machine. The language was designed to make it easier to create games for the [COSMAC VIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COSMAC_VIP) microcomputer.

This project is an almost complete reimplementation of the CHIP-8 virtual machine. ~~Although sound is not implemented yet.~~

## Building and Running

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Zig version `0.15.1` or higher is required. Since the `0.14.1` release, many Standard Library APIs have been changed, revamped, or removed. See the [release notes](https://ziglang.org/download/0.15.1/release-notes.html) for details.

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

Run the emulator:
```bash
./zig-out/bin/chip8 <rom file>
```
